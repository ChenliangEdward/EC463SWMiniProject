# Recipe Builder
This cross-platform mobile application allows a user to create an account, search or scan food items to find nutritional facts using an FDA API, and build recipes with individual ingredients to save for future use. User account data is stored using Google Firebase. 

# What We Learned
- how to use ther React Native development enviroment with the React JavaScript library to develop our user interfaces + Expo as a framework to deploy and make live changes to the React application

- how to use the Firebase backend services to store and fetch JSON data and authenticate user login information securely 

- how to use APIs to access/request data and process response data

# Screenshots of App (iOS)

# Further possible improvements

- fix bugs (delay in display of ingredient for new recipe)
- add Google authentication/more secure login
- add photos to saved recipes
- general UI improvements
